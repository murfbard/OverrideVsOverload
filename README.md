OverrideVsOverload
==================

A simple explanation of and Override method and an Overload method

Program calls both the base and derived functions.

OriginalOutput.cs	is the base class.  
OverrideOutput.cs is the derived class.

OVERRIDE
The "ShowOutput(*)" functions in the OverrideOutput class override the functions in OriginalOutput.

OVERLOAD
In both the OriginalOutput and OverrideOutput classes you will find two versions of "ShowOutput(*)."  The proper one is called depending on what parameter is passed with the function.
